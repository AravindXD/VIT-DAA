## Insertion sort with Negative numbers
Given a sequence of n numbers (integers), write an algorithm and the corresponding code to arrange the given n numbers are arranged in such a way that all the negative numbers (if any) are arranged in a descending order and all the positive numbers are arranged in an increasing order with zero (if it is in the input) appearing between the smallest negative number and the smallest positive number.

- Input format:
    ```
    Enter the number of numbers n
    Enter the first number
    Enter the second number
    .....
    Enter the n-th number
    ```
- Output format:
    ```
    Numbers in the given order
    ```
- Example:
    - Input:
        ```
