## Merge-sort algorithm with three subarrays
In the merge-sort alogrithm, an array is divided into two subarrays whenever the ‘divison’ is applied. Modify the merge-sort algorithm in such a way that every divison leads to three subarrays. Write the code for the modified algorithm and compare the efficiency of the modified algorithm with that of the original algorithm.


- Input format:
Enter the number of numbers n
Enter the first number
Enter the second number
.....
Enter the n-th number

- Output format:
    ```
    Numbers in the increasing order
    ```

- Example:
    - Input:
        ```
        6
        5
        5.5
        6
        3.723
        1.23
        8.88
        ```
    - Output:
        ```
        1.23
        3.723
        5
        5.5
