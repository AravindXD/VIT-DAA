## Cut into lengths 3 or 5
A variation of rod cutting problem is one in which length of the rod will be of length greater than or equal to 8 and you can make cuts of rods of length 3 or 5 only. For each unit of wastage a penalty of Rs.1 should be given. Write an recursive algorithm and implement it to find the maximum  revenue that may be generated.

- Input Format
    ```
    First line contains the length of the rod,n
    Next line contains the price of rod of length 3 and 5 separated by a space
    ```
- Output Format
    ```
    Print the maximum revenue that may be generated
    ```
 
- Example:

    - Input:
        ```
        3
        1 5
        ```
